# raycasting_project
My raycasting project.

Most proud of smooth and speed.

In this project i use camera plane algorithm. This helps to avoid the fish eye effect.

Strong validation of config file. You can change it as you want, and upload your own textures in .xpm format.

"make screen" for screenshot of first rendered image.
